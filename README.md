# Portfolio website

<br>

**[martinamokosova.github.io](https://martinamokosova.github.io)** is a personal website to publish **data analytics** and **data visualisation** projects I have worked on.

HTML and CSS templates are from [uiCookies](https://uicookies.com/), images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and adapted by myself.

Preparing the website has been a steep learning curve due to my basic knowledge of html and css. I found it a great way to learn and understand web development better, however I advise this way of learning only after following a basic to mid level html/css course.

There are still a few things that I would like to improve on the website, such as:
- adding a comments section, or 
- adding a modal to enlarge images, or
- fixing some bugs for mobile screens.

If someone knows how to do that I would be grateful for any help or advice.

I hope you can find the published projects helpful for your needs and if you have questions / feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me.
