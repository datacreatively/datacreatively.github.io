When looking at the seismicity regionally, a clear pattern can be noticed in several areas. 
One such example is Scotland, where most of the earthuakes are clustered on the western coast. Three of those earthquakes are above the magnitude 5ML, out of which two closely located shallower earthquakes with depth between 5km and 15km and one deeper earthquake above 20km. Most of the smaller earthquakes in Scotland have low depth.
Another area with several earthqakes is a region covering North West England, West Midlands, a part of East Midlands and also northern and southern coasts of Wales. Majority of the bigger earthquakes with magnitude above 5ML are located in Wales and a few in West Midlands. All those earthquakes are more than 10km deep, three of which are more than 25km deeply in the earthcrust. Smaller magnitude earthquakes from this area are generally shallow, less than 10km under the ground.
Clusters covering smaller areas include south west coast of the South West England, the east coast of South East England and two clusters located in the North Sea. The offshore area also registered the largest earthquake ever recorded in the UK territory with magnitude 6.1ML and depth 23km.
All remaining regions show zero to low seismicity.
